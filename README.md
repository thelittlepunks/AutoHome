Summary: Integration and enhancement of existing low level home automation capabilities

Details:
Many cheap and low level hardware and software components exist as building blocks for homebrew home automation. Each has its own method of configuring, querying and controlling. AutoHome provides some glue to assist the integration of these components and add functionality that is greater than the sum of the parts.

Example:
- Enhancing a web camera monitoring solution on a Windows PC to enable/disable alerting automatically when certain mobile devices are within local range. Additionally when an alert is triggered have a Raspberry PI speak to the intruder.

- Use a non-invasive current sensor to detect when a stovetop is used and turn on the extractor fan automatically. Turning off again 30 mins after the stovetop has been turned off.
